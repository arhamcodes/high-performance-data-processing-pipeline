### Phase 0: The Setup

This is a critical, one-time setup that will save you a lot of headaches later.

1.  **Project Repository:** Create a new GitHub repository. Write an initial `README.md` file outlining the project's purpose, the tech stack, and the problem it solves. This forces you to think about the "why" before the "how."
2.  **Environment Setup:**
    * Install Docker and Docker Compose. This is non-negotiable for a professional-grade project.
    * Set up your preferred IDEs for Python, Go, and C#/Java.
    * Install `git` and configure it.
3.  **Basic Scaffolding:** Create the initial directory structure for your project:
    * `api-python/` (for the Python API)
    * `worker-go/` (for the Go worker)
    * `legacy-java/` or `legacy-csharp/` (for the "legacy" service)
    * `infra/` (for Docker Compose and monitoring configuration)

### Phase 1: The Core Services

Focus on building the minimal viable product for the three core services. Don't worry about integration or fancy features yet.

1.  **Python Ingestion API (`api-python/`)**
    * Create a `FastAPI` or `Flask` application.
    * Define a single `POST /ingest` endpoint that accepts a JSON payload.
    * For now, this endpoint will just validate the payload and print it to the console. No queue or database yet.
    * Create a `Dockerfile` for this service.
2.  **Go Worker Service (`worker-go/`)**
    * Create a basic Go application.
    * Write a simple loop that simulates processing data (e.g., a function that takes a string, performs a mock calculation, and prints the result).
    * Create a `Dockerfile` for this service.
3.  **"Legacy" Service (`legacy-java/` or `legacy-csharp/`)**
    * Create a minimal `Spring Boot` (Java) or `ASP.NET Core` (C#) web application.
    * Define a single `POST /process` endpoint that accepts a simple JSON payload and just prints it.
    * Create a `Dockerfile` for this service.
4.  **Initial Integration:** Write a basic `docker-compose.yml` file to spin up all three services. Verify they can all start and run without errors.

### Phase 2: Asynchronous Communication and Persistence

Now, we'll introduce the message queue and databases to make the system robust.

1.  **Message Queue Setup:**
    * Add RabbitMQ (or another message queue service) to your `docker-compose.yml` file.
    * Modify your Python API: Instead of printing the payload, it will now publish the payload as a message to the RabbitMQ queue.
2.  **Go Worker Integration:**
    * Modify the Go worker to connect to the RabbitMQ queue.h
    * Change the Go application's loop to consume messages from the queue.
    * For now, the Go worker will just print the message it receives.
3.  **Database Integration:**
    * Add PostgreSQL and Redis to your `docker-compose.yml`.
    * **Python API:** Modify the API to also save a record of the ingested data (e.g., `id`, `timestamp`, `status: pending`) to PostgreSQL before sending it to the queue.
    * **Go Worker:** After processing, the Go worker will save a new record to Redis (e.g., a cache of processed data).

### Phase 3: The Adapter Pattern and Professional Polish

This phase elevates the project from a good demo to an impressive portfolio piece.

1.  **Go Worker's "Legacy" Integration:**
    * Modify the Go worker's processing function. After it "processes" the data, it will now make an HTTP `POST` request to the "legacy" C#/Java service's `/process` endpoint.
    * Implement an **Adapter Pattern:** Create a Go interface (e.g., `LegacyService`) and a concrete implementation that handles the HTTP request to the C#/Java service. This shows you understand design patterns.
    * The Go worker should check the response from the legacy service. If the status is OK, it will update the status of the item in the PostgreSQL database to "processed." If not, it will update it to "failed."
2.  **Robust Error Handling:**
    * In all services, add robust error handling. What if the database is down? What if the queue is full? What if the legacy service returns an error?
    * Implement retries for the Go worker when it calls the legacy service.
3.  **API Enhancements:**
    * In the Python API, add a `GET /status/{id}` endpoint to query the status of a specific job from the PostgreSQL database.
4.  **Logging:** Add structured logging to all three services. Use a JSON logger in each language to ensure a consistent output.

### Phase 4: Observability and Automation

This is the phase that screams "hire me." A working product is good; a working, monitored, and automated product is a goldmine.

1.  **Monitoring Setup:**
    * Add Prometheus and Grafana to your `docker-compose.yml`.
    * Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from your Go worker and Python API. Look up `promhttp` for Go and a Prometheus client library for Python.
    * Create a basic Grafana dashboard to visualize key metrics: number of requests to the Python API, number of messages consumed by the Go worker, processing time, and error rates.
2.  **CI/CD Pipeline:**
    * Set up a simple `GitHub Actions` workflow.
    * The workflow should trigger on a push to `main`.
    * It should build and test your services.
    * It should push the Docker images to a container registry.
    * (Optional but highly impressive) It can trigger a deployment to a cloud service.
3.  **Final Polish:**
    * Clean up all your code and comments.
    * Finalize your `docker-compose.yml` to make it easy for others to run.

### Phase 5: The Final Showcase

This is where you package everything to make it irresistible to an employer.

1.  **The README.md:** This is the most important part.
    * Write a detailed overview of the project's architecture. Use a simple diagram.
    * Explain the role of each service and why you chose that language.
    * Detail the communication between services.
    * Provide step-by-step instructions on how to run the project with Docker Compose.
    * Explain the observability setup and how to view the Grafana dashboard.
    * Highlight the CI/CD pipeline.
    * Describe the "legacy" service integration and your use of the Adapter Pattern.
2.  **Live Deployment:**
    * Deploy your services to a free-tier cloud provider.
    * Add a link to the live deployment and your live Grafana dashboard in the `README`.
3.  **Portfolio Review:**
    * Take a step back. Review your code, your documentation, and the overall project.
    * Prepare a short, confident pitch that you can use in interviews to describe this project and what you learned from it.
